## How to Install Ansible on AWS Instance

### Ubuntu
1. Add Ansible PPA:
```bash
# apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
 Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
