## AWS Account ID and Alias

### Find your AWS Account ID
You can find your AWS account ID number on the AWS Management Console, choose `Support` on the navigation bar on the upper-right, and then choose `Support Center`.

### Create Account Alias
If you want the URL for your sign-in page to contain your company name (or other friendly identifier) instead of your AWS account ID, you can create an alias for your AWS account ID. 

To Create or remove an account alias from UI
* Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
* On the navigation pane, select Dashboard.
* Find the IAM users sign-in link, and click Customize to the right of the link.
* Type the name you want to use for your alias, then click Yes, Create.
* To remove the alias, click Customize, and then click Yes, Delete. The sign-in URL reverts to using your AWS account ID.
